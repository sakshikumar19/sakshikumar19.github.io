Key learnings:
- first step is always prompting
- choose the right model. Base models are not for chatting
- Intruct fine tune if needed
- Inference API is not good for data privacy.
- Start with RAG, but have a quality annotation process for building up your fine-tuning data set. Fine tune, then try the fine tuned model with RAG. But always keep the feedback loop for building the tuning data.
- Look up and spend time on SOTA techniques before getting started!
